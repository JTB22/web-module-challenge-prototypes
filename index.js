/*
  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + .eat() should recieve a string as a parameter and take some type of edible as an argument
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach` array.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` array should be empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"
*/

console.log('Task 1: ', person1,'\n toString: ', person1.toString(), '\n');


/*
  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method
      + should take 'gallons' as an parameter which will take number of gallons as an argument
      + should add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.
*/

function Car(model, mpg) {
  this.model = model;
  this.milesPerGallon = mpg;

const car1 = new Car('Honda', 30);
car1.fill(10);
console.log('Task 2: ', car1, car1.drive(1000),);

/*
  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies also have the ability to `.play()`:
        + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.
*/

function Baby(name, age, favToy) {
  Person.call(this, name, age);
  this.favoriteToy = favToy;

  return `Playing with ${this.favoriteToy}`;
}
const baby1 = new Baby('Mary', 50, 'ball');
console.log('Task 3: ', baby1, '\n', baby1.play(),);

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. refers to an object
  2. the object it refers to is decided by where this is called
  3. if this is not called in a function, it refers to the window
  4. this can be implicitly or explicitly defined using call or bind
